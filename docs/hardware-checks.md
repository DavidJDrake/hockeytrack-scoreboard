# Hardware checks

Seven things the test suite cannot prove. Each is run on real hardware and its
result recorded here — including failures, which are the useful ones.

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-12-device-image-design.md`

| ID | Check | Pass criterion | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | systemd hardening against kmsdrm | The panel renders with the hardened unit | not yet run |
| H2 | polkit grant | The `scoreboard` account applies a connection | not yet run |
| H3 | Real `nmcli` scan and apply | Networks list; joining one succeeds | not yet run |
| H4 | Imager customisation on a custom image | The dialog is offered and the settings take effect | not yet run |
| H5 | Image boots | Both boards boot and the panel lights up | not yet run |
| H6 | CMA on the Zero 2 W | 480×1920 renders without CMA exhaustion | not yet run |
| H7 | Keyboard under kmsdrm | A USB keyboard drives the settings screen | not yet run |

H4, H5 and H6 need an image, so they belong to B2. H1, H2, H3 and H7 can be run
as soon as this plan is installed on a Pi.

## H1 — systemd hardening against kmsdrm

    sudo systemctl restart scoreboard && journalctl -u scoreboard -f

First confirm the service account actually has the groups it needs, since the
unit no longer declares them and so no longer fails loudly when one is missing:

    id scoreboard

Expect `video`, `render` and `input`. `gpio` only if the buttons are fitted.

Pass: the panel renders. Fail: it stays black, or the journal shows a
permission error opening `/dev/dri/card0` or `/dev/input/event*`.

Bisect by commenting directives out one at a time, starting with
`ProtectSystem=strict` and `DeviceAllow`. **Record every directive removed and
the symptom that justified it** — a hardened unit that does not render is worth
less than a plain one that does, but an undocumented removal is worth least of
all.

## H2 — polkit grant

    sudo -u scoreboard nmcli device wifi list
    sudo -u scoreboard nmcli device wifi connect <ssid> password <password>

Pass: both succeed. Fail: "insufficient privileges" or an authentication
prompt, which means the rule did not match — check the action id in
`journalctl -u polkit` against the three in the rules file, since they are
version-dependent.

## H3 — real nmcli scan and apply

From the panel, press `S`. Pass: the list shows real networks with plausible
signal strengths, arrow keys move the selection, and joining one connects.

Check specifically that an SSID containing a colon appears intact — that is
what `split_terse` exists for, and it is the one case a fake `nmcli` can only
approximate.

## H4 — Imager customisation on a custom image

Open Raspberry Pi Imager, choose "Use custom", select the built `.img.xz`.

Pass: the OS customisation dialog is offered, and hostname, user and Wi-Fi
take effect on first boot. Fail: no dialog — in which case document
`/boot/firmware/scoreboard-wifi.txt` as the flash-time path in the README and
say so plainly on the download page.

## H5 — image boots

Flash and boot on a Pi 4 and a Zero 2 W. Pass: both reach the "Not registered"
screen. Note the time to first pixel on the Zero — it is the number that decides
whether anything needs optimising.

## H6 — CMA on the Zero 2 W

    dmesg | grep -i cma

Pass: the panel renders at 480×1920 with no CMA allocation failures. Fail: add
`dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d,cma-128` under a `[pi02]` or `[all]` filter in
`config.txt` and re-check.

## H7 — keyboard under kmsdrm

Plug a USB keyboard into the panel's Pi and press `S`.

Pass: the settings screen opens and typing works. Fail: nothing happens —
confirm the service account is in the `input` group (`id scoreboard`) and that
`DeviceAllow=char-input r` is present.

This is unproven for the existing `a` and `b` keys too: every keyboard path in
this codebase has only ever run in a desktop window or under SDL's dummy
driver, never on a panel.
